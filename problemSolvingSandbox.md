# My problem-solving framework in action

## 1. Understand the problem

**Write it down. Write before I do.**

If I can't explain the problem to someone in plain English, I don't understand it.

## 2. Plan

In plain English, write out step-by-step what I'm going to do.

## 3. Divide and conquer

Break down my problems in planning into smaller ones.
Solve those, and I'll end up with the solution.

So now, if I'm hovering over the same square as before, uhh....

Will I need a mouseleave event or something? Could be useful.

I can hover the ships over, but I want to be able to click to drop them.

mouseover vs mouseenter vs mouseleave...
